# HTN Godot Plugin - Work in Progress
This is a plugin designed to work in the Godot Engine. It facilitates an easy to use visual node based graph editor to setup complex AI interactions for your game development needs. 

The plugin can be seen as two parts: 
- The plugin that is accessible once enabled at the top of the editor alongside the standard 2D, 3D, Script, and AssetLib buttons.
- The [Hierarchical Task Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_task_network) (HTN) Planner node that can be see under `res://addons/HTNDomainManager/HTNGameLibrary/htn_planner.tscn`

For more information on how to get started with using this plugin, please refer to the wiki pages setup with this repository.
